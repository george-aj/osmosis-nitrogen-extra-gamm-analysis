Here are the extra amounts I've come up with that were given out. The methodology I used to calculate the extra share out amount on each msg in each tx was to get the way the pool looked at the previous height and estimate the gamm share out they should have gotten, then do a ratio of recorded share out / estimated share out. Took this ratio and multiplied it by each denom in the msg and came up with the amounts.
